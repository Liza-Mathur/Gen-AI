    "- 1st we get website content and website links - all the links on the landing page - about me, career pages, contact me, blog, projects, plans, associations - whatever links the landing page of the website contains.\n",
    "- Then I make any llm to detect the important links of these list of links - which can be included in sales brochure - This will be a separate llm call - and it will ONLY send back list of links that are imp.\n",
    "- Then we will join the content on main landing page. And the imp links given by LLM, and their content in same text.\n",
    "- This will become the user input later on on our final model.\n",
    "- Now what we will do is - we will ask our another LLM to check the landing page, and the main links and their content - i.e, related pages of same company/person's website - and return a brochure for prospective customers, investors and recruits.\n",
    "- Finally we will try to stream it. "
